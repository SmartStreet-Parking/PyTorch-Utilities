## Personal PyTorch Training and Data Visualization Package

This package is an abstraction of some common things functions I use when using PyTorch. Rather than constantly having to copy over a file for each project, just creating a package that can be installed with `pip` could be beneficial.

Hopefully in the future I can have collegues also find use with this, or extend off of it.

## Setup
Just use pip:
```bash
pip install dist/pytorch_vision_utils-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
